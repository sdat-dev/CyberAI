                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Divisions for Research and Academic Affairs are pleased to announce a new university-wide
                    initiative to promote interdisciplinary team research and
                    infrastructure enhancement with a focus at the intersection of two strategic areas: <span class = "purple-font"><strong>Artificial
                        Intelligence (AI) and Cyber Security (CS).</strong></span> The initiative is
                    supported by UAlbany’s Accelerator funding allocated to projects which seek to implement the
                    University’s Strategic Plan recently developed undccer the
                    leadership of President Havidán Rodríguez.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overarching aim of AICSI is to position UAlbany as a leader in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security.
                </p>
                <p>   
                This initiative’s <span class = "purple-font"><strong>short-term goal</strong></span> is to:
                <br>
                    <span class = "purple-font"><strong>Accelerate research in AI and CS by creating interdisciplinary teams that will compete for
                    federal funding in these strategic areas.</strong></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This initiative’s <span class = "purple-font"><strong>long-term goal</strong></span> is to: 
                    <br>
                    <span class = "purple-font"><strong>Catalyze the creation of an Institute for Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.</strong></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These attainments will contribute to UAlbany’s rise in national rankings, e.g., in NSF’s Higher
                    Education Research and Development expenditures,
                    Carnegie Classifications of Institutions of Higher Education, and US News and World Reports and
                    recognition within the SUNY System as an epicenter for AI and CS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence is rapidly permeating Transportation, Communication, Healthcare, Medicine,
                    Finance, Weather Forecasting, Defense, Manufacturing, and practically
                    every field of human endeavor. AI already plays a significant role in transforming all aspects of
                    life as we know it today and CS science creates knowledge and devices
                    that underpin how that infrastructure is secure and trusted. Implementation of AI as well as
                    basic research to further develop and improve AI and Cyberdefense
                    is among the top priorities of essentially all national and regional organizations, especially those
                    responsible for promoting and advancing research, education, and
                    workforce training. Significant funds are being earmarked for research, development, and training in
                    the fields of AI and CS. Owing to the importance of AI and UAlbany’s
                    significant assets and distributed expertise across the three campuses, UAlbany has selected AI and
                    CS as strategic areas for growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical implementation of AI requires continual and secure acquisition of large data from
                    distributed sensors and detectors. The data are then processed to reveal certain
                    patterns and arrive at specific decisions followed by actions based on the algorithm used to train
                    the AI system. AI makes extensive use of secure networks in the collection
                    of information, data transport and storage, processing, and communication of the outcomes to various
                    end-users and end-nodes. Accordingly, security is imperative at various levels
                    and stages, and physical locations to maintain the integrity of the AI system. It is paramount to
                    have secure and rugged infrastructure in place to safeguard against malicious actors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secure cyber infrastructures require physically secure computer networks, data vaults, and servers
                    that are hardened against intrusion. The use of encryption and multifactor
                    authentication, early and predictive detection, neutralizing impending threats using AI, and
                    security of/from the cloud are essential. Mitigating human errors and automated
                    and coordinated rapid response to incidents of security violations are essential components of a
                    secure cyber infrastructure.
                </p>

                    UAlbany is home to our nation’s first <a href = "https://www.albany.edu/cehc">College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security,
                        and Cyber Security (CEHC)</a>. UAlbany’s expertise in AI and Cyber Security (CS) resides in
                    CEHC, the <a href = "https://www.albany.edu/ceas">College of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>,
                    the <a href = "https://www.albany.edu/cas/">College of Arts and Sciences</a> and
                    the <a href = "https://www.albany.edu/business">School of Business</a>. UAlbany researchers are known at the national and international levels for
                    their expertise and contribution to the field. They have engaged federal agencies and
                    leadership, and have given expert testimony to congressional committees to assist them in
                    formulating sound policies and plans to strengthen national cyber infrastructure and cyber security.
                    UAlbany's infrastructure includes secure data server capability and high-performance computing clusters which are extensively used by researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security Initiative (AICSI) leverages UAlbany’s faculty
                    expertise in the formation of teams in and at the interface of the two priority areas.
                    Participating UAlbany scholars will collectively identify a high-value project, develop a viable
                    plan and methodology, and pursue extramural federal support. UAlbany will provide
                    up to $25,000 to support select groups that develop outstanding white papers to assist them in the
                    preparation of extramural funding proposal(s). <span class = "purple-font"><strong>Teams may aggregate their funding
                        to increase impact as long as there is no overlap in white papers (Think Institute!).</strong></span>
