                        The programs offered by the Department of Information Security and Digital Forensics teach students how to investigate, respond to and manage incidents, such as, cyber attacks, data breaches, fraud or financial crimes, and malicious activity. Students get the opportunity to consult with Fortune 500 companies or federal government/law enforcement agencies on forensic technology, cyber risk, regulatory/compliance, and criminal investigations as well as perform cyber intelligence and systems defense related to cyber attacks. The Information Security and Digital Forensics faculty will ensure students are equipped to spot security breaches, gather electronic evidence (eDiscovery), manage risk and incident response planning and policy, and investigate regulatory compliance issues, criminal activity, and financial fraud.

                        in December 2001 by extending and broadening the scope of the Institute of Programming and Logics, which was part of the Computer Science Department since 1992. 
                        The formation of ILS represents a significant shift in the focus of the institute and its revised research priorities to address critical national security issues. 
                        ILS includes the Natural Language Information Processing Laboratory (NLIP) Lab formed in the Fall 2000.

                        The Institute’s mission is to increase the University at Albany’s reputation and visibility as a center of excellence in information technology research and education,
                         contributing to various University-wide initiatives such as bio-informatics, information science, information assurance and security (credit kim). Through collaboration
                          with key members of academia, government, and industry, the Institute is working to develop educational programs, advance pioneering research, create innovative 
                          technologies, transfer valuable knowledge and expertise, and foster an environment of cooperation and trust among its partners. We strive to create a collegial 
                          environment by bringing together students and researchers from various parts of the University and across New York State. The Institute is sponsoring a computational
                           informatics seminar series, and serves as a host for visitors from industry, academia, and research-sponsoring government agencies."
