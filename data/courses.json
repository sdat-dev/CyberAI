How can a robot identify objects in complex environments, or navigate uncharted territory? How can a video camera in the operating room help a surgeon plan a procedure more safely, or assist a radiologist in more efficiently detecting a tumor? Computer vision is at the heart of many such questions: the goal is to develop methods that enable a machine to \"understand\" or analyze images and videos, so that information can be derived from raw pixel values to support various applications. In this course, through lectures, paper presentations, and projects, we will explore fundamental topics including image formation, feature detection, segmentation, recognition and learning, and motion and tracking. We will treat computer vision as a process of inference from noisy and uncertain data and emphasize probabilistic, statistical, and data-driven approaches. Prerequisites: This course requires familiarity with calculus, basic probability theory and linear algebra, and some programming experience. Previous experience with image processing and machine learning will be useful but is not assumed. MATLAB, the language of choice for the programming assignments will be covered as part of the introduction to the course.","school":"College of Engineering and Applied Sciences","degree":"Graduate Degrees"},{"courseCode":"CSI 680","title":"Computer Science Research ","courseCredits":" (3 credits)","department":"Computer Science","description":"Introduction to independent research in computer science.
