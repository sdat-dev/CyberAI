Fundamental research will be required in robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, materials science, sustainability, education and public policy, and workforce development to take the lead in this global competition. The research supported under this solicitationwillenhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing far into the future by providing new capabilitiesfor established companies andentrepreneurs,improving ourhealth and quality of life,andreducingthe impact of manufacturing industries on the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this solicitation is to support fundamental research and education of a future workforce that will enable Future Manufacturing: manufacturing that either does not exist today or exists only at such small scales that it is not viable. Future Manufacturing will require the design and deployment of diverse new technologies for synthesis and sensing, and new algorithms for manufacturing newmaterials, chemicals, devices, components and systems. It will require new advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, new cyber infrastructure, new approaches for mathematical and computational modeling, new dynamics and control methodologies, new ways to integrate systems biology, synthetic biology and bioprocessing, and new ways to influence the economy, workforce, human behavior, and society.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong this array of technologies and potential research subjects, three thrust areas have been identified for support in FY 2020 under this solicitation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Cyber Manufacturing Research,\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Eco Manufacturing Research, and\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Biomanufacturing Research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis solicitation will support the following three award tracks:\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG)- Two types of awards will be supported in FY 2020:\r\n\r\n\r\nType I: $500,000 to $750,000 per year for up to five years,\r\n\r\n\r\nType II: $750,000 to $2,000,000 per year for up to five years;\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG)- Awards in this track will provide support for up to two years at a level not to exceed $250,000 per year; and\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Manufacturing Networks (FMNet)- Awards in this track will provide up to five years of support at a total amount of $500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterdisciplinary teams commensurate with the scope of the proposed research, education plan, and budget are required. Proposals must include demonstrated expertise among the team members to carry out the proposed research, education, and workforce development activities. The use of a convergence approach is expected[2].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see \"Full Proposal Preparation Instructions\" for additional details.\r\n\r\n\r\nRealization of thebenefitsof the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board has recently emphasized this perspective in its report, \"THE SKLLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America's Science and Engineering Enterprise.\"[3]Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titledEducation and Workforce Development Plan that describes plans toequip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see \"Full Proposal Preparation Instructions\" for additional details.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER INFORMATION: An informational webinar will be held on March 26, 2020 at 1:00 PM EST to discuss the Future Manufacturing program and answer questions about this solicitation.
